# ips-test
Senior Backend Developer Test for iPhone Photography School

## Plan to approach the exercise
* identify all entities and create tables (if they do not exist) and models. 
* understand from where we take user progress and create some entries in database in `users` and `user_completed_modules`
* create the API with dummy data and test the update in Infusionsoft for a user. 
* create the tests for new created endpoint.
* decide how we will know what tag to set based on user progress. 
There should be a correlation between how we store progress, modules names/ids and tag names. 
* create the logic to determine the correct tag for an user based on progress. 
* set the tag.
